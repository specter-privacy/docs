title: "README discrepancies"
description: "Claims from provided README that do not match current implementation"
---

This page flags differences between the provided long-form README content and current backend code.

## Verified discrepancies

1. **API publish requirements differ from README snippets**
- Current API requires `tx_hash` when publishing announcements.
- Some README/script examples omit `tx_hash`.
- Source: `../SPECTER/specter/specter-api/src/dto.rs`, `../SPECTER/specter/specter-api/src/handlers.rs`, `../SPECTER/scripts/e2e-stealth-flow.sh`

2. **Endpoint names differ from earlier docs**
- Current upload endpoint is `/api/v1/ipfs/upload` (not `/api/v1/ens/upload`).
- Source: `../SPECTER/specter/specter-api/src/routes.rs`

3. **Solana implementation is not present in backend workspace**
- README discusses Solana support/architecture.
- No `specter-solana` crate exists in current Rust workspace.
- Source: `../SPECTER/specter/Cargo.toml`

4. **Some Yellow flows are scaffolded, not full settlement execution in API**
- Close/fund handlers return placeholder transaction behavior.
- Source: `../SPECTER/specter/specter-api/src/handlers.rs`

5. **Certain crate/file descriptions in README do not match current files**
- Example: ENS crate references to older module names (`ipfs.rs`, `ccip.rs`) are not present in current workspace.
- Source: `../SPECTER/specter/specter-ens/src`

6. **Roadmap features are not implemented in current codebase**
- Features like OAPA, PQ account abstraction wallet, privacy keystore, and migration contracts are roadmap content, not implemented modules.
- Source: workspace crate list in `../SPECTER/specter/Cargo.toml`

Treat this page as the source-of-truth boundary between implemented behavior and roadmap/vision material.
