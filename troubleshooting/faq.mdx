## Does the API enforce auth?

No. Auth is not implemented in current API route middleware.

## Does SPECTER currently support Solana in backend code?

No. Current backend code supports Ethereum and Sui flows. Solana content in README is roadmap-level.

## Are Yellow channel close transactions fully on-chain from this API?

Not in current backend handlers. Close flow returns placeholder transaction hashes and depends on external Yellow processing.

## Is there built-in rate limiting?

No. Add it at gateway or proxy layer.

## Where are key protocol constants defined?

In `specter-core/src/constants.rs`.
