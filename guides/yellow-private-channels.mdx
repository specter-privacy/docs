## Create flow

1. Call `POST /api/v1/yellow/channel/create` with recipient, token, amount.
2. Receive generated stealth address and announcement data.
3. Backend publishes announcement with channel metadata to registry.

## Discover flow

1. Recipient calls `POST /api/v1/yellow/channel/discover` with keys.
2. API scans registry and returns discovered channels.

## Practical caveats

- Fund and close endpoints return placeholder tx hashes in current backend behavior.
- Final settlement is dependent on external Yellow infra and not fully executed by this backend.
