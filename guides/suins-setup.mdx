title: "Set up SuiNS receiving"
description: "Publish your SPECTER meta-address for SuiNS-based receiving"
---

## Goal

Configure `name.sui` so senders can resolve your SPECTER meta-address.

## Steps

1. Generate keys.
2. Upload your meta-address bytes to IPFS.
3. Set SuiNS `content_hash` to `ipfs://CID`.
4. Verify with `GET /api/v1/suins/resolve/:name`.

## Verify resolution

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/v1/suins/resolve/alice.sui | jq .
```

## Notes

- SuiNS resolution depends on configured `SUI_RPC_URL`.
- `USE_TESTNET=true` switches SuiNS table/package constants to testnet values.
