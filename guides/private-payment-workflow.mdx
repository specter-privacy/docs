## Sender workflow

1. Resolve recipient name to meta-address.
2. Call `POST /api/v1/stealth/create`.
3. Send funds to returned `stealth_address`.
4. Publish announcement with `ephemeral_key`, `view_tag`, and `tx_hash`.

## Recipient workflow

1. Keep `viewing_sk`, `spending_pk`, and `spending_sk` secure.
2. Call `POST /api/v1/stealth/scan` periodically.
3. Import `eth_private_key` into wallet if needed to move funds.

## Verification checks

- Created and discovered `stealth_address` should match.
- Discovery should include the same `announcement_id` and metadata you published.
