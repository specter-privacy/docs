## Post-Quantum Privacy for Ethereum and Sui

SPECTER is the first production-ready protocol for **quantum-resistant private payments**. It enables users to receive assets without revealing their primary address, protecting them from surveillance and future quantum threats.

    Secured by **ML-KEM-768** (Kyber), the NIST standard for post-quantum cryptography.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Chain Support" icon="link">
    Native support for **Ethereum (EVM)** and **Sui**, with more chains coming soon.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stealth Addressing" icon="user-secret">
    Derive unique, unlinkable addresses for every transaction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decentralized Registry" icon="globe">

## Application Status

<Note>
**Active Development**: SPECTER is currently in **Alpha**. The protocol is stable and reusable, but we are rapidly evolving the SDKs and adding new features.
</Note>

We are actively working on:
- 🟡 **Yellow Network Integration**: High-speed, cross-chain state channels.
- 🟡 **Mobile SDKs**: Native iOS and Android libraries.
- 🟢 **Audits**: Preparing for comprehensive security reviews.
