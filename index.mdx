## Post-Quantum Privacy for Ethereum and Sui

SPECTER is the first production-ready protocol for **quantum-resistant private payments**. It enables users to receive assets without revealing their primary address, protecting them from surveillance and future quantum threats.

## Application Status

<Note>
**Active Development**: SPECTER is currently in **Alpha**. The protocol is stable and reusable, but we are rapidly evolving the SDKs and adding new features.
</Note>

We are actively working on:
- 🟡 **Yellow Network Integration**: High-speed, cross-chain state channels.
- 🟡 **Mobile SDKs**: Native iOS and Android libraries.
- 🟢 **Audits**: Preparing for comprehensive security reviews.
