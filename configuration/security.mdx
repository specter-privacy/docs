## Secret handling

- Never expose `spending_sk` or `viewing_sk` in logs.
- Discovery responses include `eth_private_key`; treat it as wallet-signing material.
- Use environment secrets management for Pinata and RPC credentials.

## Code-level protections

- Secret keys and stealth private keys implement zeroization behavior.
- Constant-time comparisons are used for sensitive equality checks.
- Crates forbid `unsafe` code.
- SHAKE256 operations use explicit domain separators.

## API hardening recommendations

- Put API behind authentication and role-based access.
- Add per-IP and per-endpoint rate limiting.
- Audit announcement publish permissions and tx-hash verification policies.
