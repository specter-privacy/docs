## View-tag filtering

With one-byte view tags, you avoid most decapsulation work.

- Tag space: 256
- Expected false positives: ~0.39%
- Expected filtered announcements: ~99.6%

## Scanner tuning

Use scanner config for workload control:

- Narrow by timestamps
- Restrict view-tag buckets
- Stop on first discovery for low-latency probes

## Run benchmarks

```bash
cd SPECTER/specter
cargo bench -p specter-crypto
cargo run --bin specter -- bench --count 100000
```
