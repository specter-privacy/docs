SPECTER does not currently include an automated release pipeline in-repo.

## Suggested release checklist

1. Run full test suite.
2. Validate API compatibility on key endpoints.
3. Rebuild release binary.
4. Update docs for any API/schema/flow changes.
5. Publish release notes in GitHub.

## Build release binary

```bash
cd SPECTER/specter
cargo build --release
```
