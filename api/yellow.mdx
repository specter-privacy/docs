title: "Yellow endpoints"
description: "Private channel API endpoints and current implementation boundaries"

## Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/yellow/channel/create`
- `POST /api/v1/yellow/channel/discover`
- `POST /api/v1/yellow/channel/fund`
- `POST /api/v1/yellow/channel/close`
- `GET /api/v1/yellow/channel/:id/status`
- `POST /api/v1/yellow/transfer`
- `GET /api/v1/yellow/config`

## What is implemented

- Channel-create flow generates stealth payment + announcement data
- Channel discovery scans announcement registry with provided keys
- Config endpoint returns Yellow network + token metadata

## Important limitations

- Some responses are placeholders (`tx_hash` values in fund/close flows)
- Close handler explicitly notes no L1 transaction submission by backend
- `token` handling in discovery/status is simplified

<Warning>
Treat Yellow API behavior as integration scaffolding. Validate final settlement and balance behavior with the external Yellow stack before production rollout.
