## ML-KEM-768 constants

| Parameter | Size |
| --- | --- |
| Public key | 1184 bytes |
| Secret key | 2400 bytes |
| Ciphertext | 1088 bytes |
| Shared secret | 32 bytes |

## Core cryptographic operations

1. `generate_keypair()` creates ML-KEM keypairs.
2. `encapsulate(public_key)` returns `(ciphertext, shared_secret)`.
3. `decapsulate(ciphertext, secret_key)` recovers `shared_secret`.
4. `compute_view_tag(shared_secret)` computes a 1-byte tag.

## View tags and scanning efficiency

SPECTER uses a 1-byte view tag space (256 values):

- False positive rate: `1 / 256` (about `0.39%`)
- Filter efficiency: about `99.6%`

## Address derivation

SPECTER currently derives wallet-compatible stealth keys using secp256k1 seed derivation:

- Seed is derived via SHAKE256 domain-separated hash
- Ethereum address is derived from secp256k1 public key (`keccak256` path)
- Sui address is derived from secp256k1 compressed key (`blake2b-256` path)

<Info>
The repository still contains legacy Kyber-public-key derivation helpers, but active send/scan paths use the secp256k1 seed flow for wallet compatibility.

## Security properties implemented in code

- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` across core crates
- Secret material zeroization (`zeroize`)
- Constant-time equality checks (`subtle::ConstantTimeEq`)
- Domain separation constants for SHAKE256 operations
