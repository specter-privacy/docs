## Required before launch

- Configure all required env vars
- Validate `/health` and full create/publish/scan flow
- Place service behind auth and rate-limiting controls
- Enable observability and log retention
- Define backup and restore process for registry data

## Operational checks

- Monitor error rates for ENS/SuiNS/IPFS lookups
- Track registry growth and scanning latency
- Rotate infrastructure credentials periodically

## Suggested rollout phases

| Phase | Goal | Exit criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 | Internal validation | End-to-end quickstart succeeds repeatedly |
| Phase 2 | Staging hardening | Auth/rate-limit/monitoring controls in place |
| Phase 3 | Public exposure | Runbook + incident response documented |

<details>
<summary><strong>Helpful production UX idea</strong></summary>

Build a simple operator dashboard with:

- `/health` snapshot
- announcement publish success/failure rate
- scan latency percentile
- ENS/SuiNS resolution error trend

</details>
