## Railway

SPECTER includes `railway.json` with health check path:

- Start command: `/app/specter serve`
- Health endpoint: `/health`

## AWS / GCP / Azure pattern

No provider-specific Terraform/CloudFormation is included. A common setup is:

1. Build container from `specter/Dockerfile`
2. Deploy to managed container service
3. Inject env vars from secret manager
4. Expose via API gateway/load balancer
5. Add centralized logs + metrics

<Warning>
Provider-specific IaC is not currently maintained in this repository.
